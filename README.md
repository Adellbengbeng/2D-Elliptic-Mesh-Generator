# 2D_Orthogonal_Grid_Generator
This is a <b>2D orthogonal elliptic grid generator</b> which utilizes the Winslow (modified Laplace) partial differential equations. 
It also utlizes univariate stretching functions and a tilted parabola tangent line fitter (original discovery). The grid generator 
is packaged as a Java program which can be compiled and exectuted via the command line. The program allows one to choose
from six different boundary types: rectangular, gaussian, absolute value, greatest-integer, forwards step and semi-ellipse. Then one must
specify the coordinates of the grid domain (warning: the domain must be perfectly square). Finally, one can choose to add refinements
to the grid, such as orthogonality adjustment and stretching functions. The program will then generate an initial course grid and
iteratively refine it to produce a smooth grid with the given parameters and refinement options. A detailed analysis of the quality of the 
resulting grid will also be provided. 

## Elliptic Grid Generation Algorithm
Firstly to construct an an initial grid, the Transfinite Interpolation algorithm will be applied to the given domain constrained by the
specified boundary conditions. Next, the Winslow equations are applied to the grid using the method of mixed order finite differences, 
thereby generating a system of equations for each one dimensional line of nodes in the grid. This system of equations is then 
modeled in matrix representation, resulting in a tri-diagonal matrix. This matrix is then solved using the Thomas Tri-Diagonal Matrix
Algorithm. The solution to the current iteration is then further processed by the orthogonaliy adjustment algorithm and stretching
function methods as necessary.

## Orthogonality Adjustment Algorithm
In several computational fluid dynamics applications, an orthogonal grid is necessary in certain regions to improve the accuracy
of calculations. However, it is not always possible to achieve a fully orthogonal solution, and thus the problem becomes finding a 
nearly-orthogonal solution to an arbitrarily defined domain.
